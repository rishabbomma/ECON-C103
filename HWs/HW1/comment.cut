Let $u,v \in \close{Y}$ and by the properties of $\close{Y}$ there do exist sequences in $Y$ $u_n$ and $v_n$ such that $(u_n) \tend u$ and $(v_n) \tend v$. Additionally, let $a,b \in K$, $z_n = au_n + bv_n$, and $z = au + bv$. Since $Y$ is a subspace of $X$, $u_n, v_n,$ and $z_n$ are all contained within it and now to show that $\close{Y}$ is a subspace of $X$, we ned only show that $(z_n) \tend z$. Consider $\frac{\epsilon}{2\abs{a}}>0$ and $\frac{\epsilon}{2\abs{b}}>0$ then there exists $N_1$ and $N_2$ such that for all $n_1>N_1$ and $n_2>N_2$, we have that $\norm{u_n -u} <\frac{\epsilon}{2\abs{a}}$ and $\norm{v_n - v} < \frac{\epsilon}{2\abs{b}}$. Thus, for $n> N = \max\{N_1,N_2\}$, $\norm{z_n - z} = \norm{au_n + bv_n - u - v} = \norm{a(u_n - u) + b(v_n -v)} \leq \abs{a}\norm{u_n -u} + \abs{b}\norm{v_n -v}<\abs{a} \frac{\epsilon}{2\abs{a}} + \abs{b}\frac{\epsilon}{2\abs{b}} = \frac{\epsilon}{2} +  \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon \RIGHT \norm{z_n - z} < \epsilon $ for an arbitrarily chosen $\epsilon>0$. Thus, $(z_n) \tend z$ and since $z_n \in Y$ for each $n$, $z \in \close{Y}$ and thus $\close{Y}$ is a subspace of $X$ $\QED$
